# odin-tic-tac-toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game, again for The Odin Project's Javascript course.

TODO:
1. Allow the players to choose their names and colors
2. Implement an AI for Player O
3. Polish up the keyboard functionality: I do have it working for tabbing focus and pushing Enter to select the cell, but I'd like to get it working with arrows or WASD to move around the board.
4. Probably more styling -- it's a little bare-bones at the moment.
